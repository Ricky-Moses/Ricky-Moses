### Fun Fact 😁 ###
> [!Caution]
> *I don’t chase perfection.* <br />
> *I design systems with intent, bending logic until it aligns with purpose — like Fang Yuan shaping fate.* <br />
> *I move quietly, like Ayanokoji, letting clean architecture and efficient code speak louder than words.* <br />
> *I carry the weight of solving real problems, knowing — like Eren — that some structures must fall for innovation to rise.* <br />
> *And bugs? I don’t debug. I dominate the issue, like Sukuna staring down a cursed domain.* <br /> <br />
> *My IDE(**VS Code**) is my workspace.* <br />
> *My mind is optimized for patterns and clarity.* <br />
> *And every app I build is one more system that obeys — not resists — its creator.* <br /> <br />
